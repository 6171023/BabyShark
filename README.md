# BabyShark
A retro python game using Pyxel to create a fun game called BabyShark

Concept:
The game is about a shark ‘consuming’ or ‘eating’ babies to regain health that may be deteriorated due to the plastic bottles thrown into the ocean. There is no specific reasoning behind why I thought of “shark eating babies”. Due to the song title, I just wanted to include a baby and a shark somehow and given my game proposal and concept of the basic working of the game, this is what I could think of at that moment. The baby in the game represents humans who ruin the ocean by throwing in plastic bottles.

In summary, the code does the following:
- Displays decorative graphics in the first screen
- Displays options to choose from after user input of ENTER key; play game, look at the rules, look at the context of the game, exit the app.
- Songs are added at certain situations of the game.
- Shark at the bottom of the screen is controlled by the player’s mouse
- If the menu page, or the page with rules or context is run more than once, the text will not appear in animation (to save the player from going through the wait of all the options or text from appearing in animation while taking time)
- Once the shark consumes a baby, the image of the shark is replaced with an image that has blood coming out of the shark’s mouth.
- When the user clicks on the required option to exit the game, a message is displayed after which the window will close after a few seconds.
